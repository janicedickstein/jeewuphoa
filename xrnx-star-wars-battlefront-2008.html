Прошу прощения за долгое ожидание. First off, I apologize if this doesn't belong here, or if this is an overdone topic. As you can probably tell, I'm new here. So, Star Wars. Never watched 'em. 19 years old and never seen Star Wars. The only experience I had with it is all the references and stuff you'd see on TV, and playing the first Lego SW games, covering the prequels. I always told myself that I didn't need to watch them because "I just knew" that I'd hate them, they were overhyped blah blah blah. Despite

WARNING LONG RANT AND BACKSTORY INCOMING amp#x200B; I have always been a die hard star wars fan, I remember in the third grade haveing fake lightsaber fights with my friends and playing the battlefront games on my PS2. I remember forcing my mom to sit and watch the movie trilogies back to back with me. In the library I would always make a beeline for the star wars visual dictionaries (https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star\_Wars:\_Attack\_of\_the\_Clones\_Incredible\_Cross-Sections) 
My greatest worry for this game is basically what happened to BFV, Star Wars Battlefront 2 etc. Especially since this game is promoted as a live service game. I am this games target audience. Ive been waiting for a good Ironman game since 2008. Honestly QoL and bugs aside. I dont see this game attracting the traditional Bioware audience like Mass Effect. The characters are far too bland and the world lacks cohesion. Ill have fun with this game. I didnt cancel my LOD Ps4 order even though. Let me just start by saying that Disney can do whatever they want with Star Wars, they are the legal owners of Lucasfilm and all it's Intellectual Properties. They can license Star Wars to whoever they want. This is one fan's perspective who's played a multitude of Star Wars games over the years. My Background with Star Wars Games: I was born in 2000 so I was too young to get deep into the prequels when they came out in theaters. Around the time of Revenge of the Sith there It really sucks to see the direction Star Wars has taken over Marvel. Star Wars had the potential to ride our huge on its new movies, games, books, etc, yet hasn’t. It’s first movie comes out but was well received all around, not the best but it kept the community waiting for the next movie, (imo it was worse than TLJ simply because of all the rehashing) it’s sequel however, quite obviously doesn’t build well upon it, with hype for episode 9 getting lower than other movies out there which. 6:27PM EST 1/13/2019 - UPDATED WITH NEW THINGS!!! PSVita, Gamecube, N64 and more located at the bottom of the post. More will keep coming! 10:45AM EST 1/14/2019 - All packages from the past couple of days have shipped out! Thanks for all the pleasant transactions so far! https://imgur.com/a/Z1jqT0r amp#x200B; Hello r/GameSale! The time has come and gone for my gaming collection. I have culled it down by over half and this thread is the byproduct of that. Yay! I'll continue to updat. With the news in EAs earnings call, released today, that Battlefield 5 missed sales expectations by a wide margin. And of course other stories that EA has abandoned Titanfall 3 and the Star Wars RPG. I decided to update the list to include those those three studios who will now inevitably release games microtransanctioned into oblivion and the resulting poor sales will give EA the excuse it needs to close the studios. For newcomers, below is a list of studios in chronological order: 1998:. + Platform: Sega Genesis + -Owned Games- + Sonic Classics Game:Loose + Sonic Spinball Game:Loose + Sonic and Knuckles Game:Loose +Platform: 32x + Knuckles Chaotix Game:Loose Hard Trade + Platform: Atari 2600 + -Owned Games- + Air-Sea Battle (Target Fun) (https://imgur.com/a/Mb1C61q) Game:Loose + Asteroids (https://imgur.com/a/YQ2d0pQ) Price:Loose + Asteroids ( Sears Telegames ) Game:Loose + Atlantis (https://imgur.com/a/VjpzIOf) Price:Loose + Basketball ( Sears. The issue is completely random. Sometimes, it freezes right away. Sometimes it's as I'm launching into a game (eg: getting into a game in Titanfall 2) or just loading anything (eg: Hero gallery in Overwatch). And usually, it's just whenever I try opening a game. Sometimes, it doesn't even happen at all. The crash is always either at the beginning of when the game is opened, in the first few minutes, or not at all. amp#x200B; The only way to get out of it is to manually reboot my computer. 
Looking mostly for NES and SNES games that I don't have yet. Biggest WANT on my list would have to be some maps/monster sheets that I'm missing from Dragon Warrior NES series and also a box for Final Fantasy II SNES. However I'm more than happy just browsing through everyone's lists! Also, besides all the games listed below I also have a few DSi's, N64's, Wii's, a Gamecube and a 360 system available as well as a ton of instructions manuals found here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d. I've kinda been wanting to vent about this shit for a while, so I guess this is the best place to do it. Ever since Disney released their abominations of movies, I've just had this bad taste in my mouth with Star Wars. Rouge One wasn't too terrible, but that's when I compare it to the rest of the garbage they've released. (One thing in particular that pisses me off about Rouge One. You make a new, cool Imperial soldier, the Death Troopers. Something they could have done a lot with. Instead Hi all, looking to downsize a bit of my collection, and in return, get a few figures I missed out on. Specifically, I'm looking for the following figures: Universe 2008 Cyclonus (any version of the mold will do) Combiner Wars Ultra Magnus (Hasbro version) Combiner Wars Optimus Prime (Voyager) Titans Return Chromedome Titans Return or Takara Legends Rewind Thrilling 30 Brainstorm (Voyager) MMC Tyrantron (3P IDW Megatron) Generation Toy GT-03 Op Ex (3P IDW Optimus - original. I'll start! My YouTube channel, Superhero Video Games ( https://www.youtube.com/cbake76 (https://www.youtube.com/cbake76)), is quickly accessed through Superhero.VG (  As I say in my description there. I’m Chris Baker, and I know a LOT about superhero video games (Star Wars ones too!). I’ve been part of the games industry for two decades, with jobs at Marvel, LucasArts and Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, to name a few. So I’ve not only had a hand in the release.

This does not include. Welcome to the first Monthly Roundup for video games in the Star Wars universe!
